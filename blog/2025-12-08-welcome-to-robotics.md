## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating intelligent agents that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. Unlike traditional AI, which often exists purely in the digital realm, Physical AI is embodied in robots that can interact with their environment.

## Why Humanoid Robotics?

Humanoid robots are designed to resemble the human body. This form factor is not just for aesthetics; it's a practical choice for robots that need to operate in human-centric environments. By having a similar body plan to humans, these robots can use the same tools, navigate the same spaces, and interact with people in a more natural way.

## What You Will Learn in This Book

This book will take you on a journey from the fundamentals of robotics to the cutting-edge of AI. You will learn about:

*   **ROS 2:** The Robot Operating System, the standard software platform for robotics.
*   **Simulation:** How to create and use realistic simulations to test and train your robots.
*   **Humanoid Kinematics and Control:** The mathematics and algorithms that allow humanoid robots to move and balance.
*   **Conversational AI:** How to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to create natural language interfaces for your robots.

We are excited to have you on this journey with us. Let's start building the future of robotics, together!
